#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering refers to the development and maintenance of software by applying engineering principles. It is important because it allows for various sectors of society such as transport, health, education etc to be efficiently run with the help of increasingly advanced software. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Creation of programming languages. This was a key milestone as it allowed people to more efficiently pass commands to computers and therefore increased the development speed and the complexity of software that could be developed.
Rise of software engineering as a discipline. This allowed developers to structure their knowledge in ways that could easily be taught to new developers and it also allowed them to carry out important research in the field thereby improving it.
Rise of agile methodologies. This is a very important milestone in that it allowed developers to communicate with their potential clients and develop projects that would better solve their problems thereby increasing the value of the software.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - Researching and gathering information about the required features of the product and what the consumers need.
Design - Creating design specifications for the various product features and architecture to provide guidelines to follow when developing the product.
Implementation - The actual coding of the product according to the design specifications.
Testing - Using the product in-house to check for any issues and fix them. 
Deployment - Releasing the product to be used by the public or relevant clients.
Maintenance - Fixing any bugs that may arise in the software after deployment and improving the product. Also involves providing computer support.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall methodology is a sequential procedure divided into phases in which one phase leads into another. This means that for the next phase to occur, the previous one must be completed, thus the developers always know the required checkpoints to complete the entire project. However, it is difficult to go back to a previous phase in case of any issues. It is very inflexible, but very predictable. It is suitable for projects that are very specific-use or have a small consumer base and have very small chances of changing significantly once deployed, such as programs to run robots in an assembly plant.
Agile methodology is an iterative procedure where the team focuses on building a certain feature at a time instead of the entire project. Each feature then gets tested and required to get feedback from consumers before being deployed. It is very flexible and emphasises customer feedback. However, it can be a bit slow due to the possibility of having to revisit various parts multiple times until it satisfies the consumers. It is suitable for projects that are very general-use or have a wide consumer base and are prone to being changed significantly multiple times such as social media apps.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer is the person tasked with the actual coding of the software.
A Quality Asssurance Engineer is a person tasked with testing the product to ensure it is up to the required standards.
A Project Manager is tasked with overseeing the entire development process and making sure it runs smoothly and on schedule by ensuring availability of the required resources.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs make development more efficient by providing tools not readily available in regular text editors such as debuggers and various extensions. An example is VS Code.
VCSs are used to track software changes to make finding bugs easier. They also enhance teamwork by allowing multiple parties to work on different parts of a project at the same time. An example is Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements - When using inflexible development methodologies such as Waterfall, a sudden change in the product requirements will cause work to halt and be pushed back to a previous stage causing delays. This can be overcome by using a flexible methodology such as Agile which can easily handle changing requirements.
Lack of budget - Sometimes developers may lack adequate finances to fund the project's required assets such as virtual computers or cloud storage. This can be fixed by various means such as crowdfunding. 
Tight deadlines - As software development is a relatively slow process, some deadlines can be impossible to meet while still delivering quality code. This can lead to developers being forced to rush and cut corners and eventually lead to a low quality product. This can be fixed by ensuring proper communication on the schedule limits and the workload during meetings.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - testing a single component or feature of a project. It ensures each part of the project is working properly on its own.
Integration testing - testing how well the components interact and work with each other. It ensures that the various parts do not cause conflicts with each other.
System testing - testing of the entire project as a whole. This ensures that the product has no issues before it is deployed.
Acceptance testing - testing the product against the user needs. This ensures that the product actually solves the problem being encountered by the consumers.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering refers to the art of crafting clear instructions to give to AI models in order to get them to do the required task as best as possible. Its importance lies in the fact that mastering it can significantly reduce the required time for various tasks as the AI will clearly understand what is required of it and deliver an optimum product in as little time as possible.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague - Create an image of a man wearing a hat
Clear - Create an image of a well-built man wearing a yankee hat
The clear prompt is better as it provides more details on what the man and hat are supposed to look like. This allows the AI model to create an image that is more tuned to the user's needs.
