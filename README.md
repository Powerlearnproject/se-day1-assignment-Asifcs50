Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering refers to the development and maintenance of software by applying engineering principles. It is important because it allows for various sectors of society such as transport, health, education etc to be efficiently run with the help of increasingly advanced software. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Creation of programming languages. This was a key milestone as it allowed people to more efficiently pass commands to computers and therefore increased the development speed and the complexity of software that could be developed.
Rise of software engineering as a discipline. This allowed developers to structure their knowledge in ways that could easily be taught to new developers and it also allowed them to carry out important research in the field thereby improving it.
Rise of agile methodologies. This is a very important milestone in that it allowed developers to communicate with their potential clients and develop projects that would better solve their problems thereby increasing the value of the software.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering refers to the art of crafting clear instructions to give to AI models in order to get them to do the required task as best as possible. Its importance lies in the fact that mastering it can significantly reduce the required time for various tasks as the AI will clearly understand what is required of it and deliver an optimum product in as little time as possible.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague - Create an image of a man wearing a hat
Clear - Create an image of a well-built man wearing a yankee hat
The clear prompt is better as it provides more details on what the man and hat are supposed to look like. This allows the AI model to create an image that is more tuned to the user's needs.
